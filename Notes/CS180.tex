	\ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Style*=--\ , Style2*=$\bullet\ $)
        & Divide and conquer
        && Class of algorithmic techniques in which one breaks input into several parts, solves subproblems recursively, and recombines into overall solution
        & Analyze running time
        && Generally will use recurrence relations
        && For divide and conquer problems, the brute force solution is typically polynomial; we are trying for a lower polynomial
	\end{easylist}

\subsection{A First Recurrence: The Mergesort Algorithm}
    \begin{easylist}  
    \ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Style*=--\ , Style2*=$\bullet\ $)
        & Mergesort
        && Sort list of numbers by dividing into two equal halves, solving each half recursively, and recombining solutions
        && T(n) $\le$ 2T(n/2) + O(n)
        && Ignore ceiling and floor issues for odd numbers, b/c not actually impactful
        & Approaches to Solving Recurrences
        && Unrolling the recurrence into a graph allows us to see how many operations are performed at each level
        &&& Identify the pattern, and sum over all levels
        && Substituting a solution into the recurrence
        &&& Requires a guess
        && Partial substitution can determine the constants
        &&& Useful for determining exact constants if we know the general form of the solution

        & More formal definition of Counting Inversions
        && Count the number of indices i \textless j which form an inversion, a$_i$ \textgreater a$_j$
        & Algorithm
        && Divide list in two halves, recursively sort and count inversions for each
        && To recombine two halves, take min of each sorted half
        && If take min from first half, no inversions are added

\section{Ch4: Greedy Algorithms}
\subsection{Introduction}
    \begin{easylist}  
    \ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Style*=--\ , Style2*=$\bullet\ $)
        & Greedy
        && Builds up solution in samll steps, choosing decision at each step to myopically optimize some underlying criterion
        && Sometimes can even create algorithms with greedy rules which are guaranteed to be close, but not equal, to optimum
        & Proving
        && Show step-by-step that greedy is better than any other algorithm, including optimal
        && Gradually exchange parts of any solution with the greedy solution, showing that the greedy never hurts the quality of solution
    \end{easylist}

\subsection{Interval Scheduling: The Greedy Algorithm Stays Ahead}
    \begin{easylist}  
    \ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Style*=--\ , Style2*=$\bullet\ $)
        & Interval Scheduling Problem Statement
        && Set of requests, each with starting and finishing time
        && Compatible (no two overlap in time) sets of maximum size is called optimal
        & Designing a Greedy
        && Use simple rule to select first request $i_1$, then reject any requests which are not compatible with $i_1$
        && Many wrong solutions
        && Smallest Finishing Time is a good rule
        && Intuition is that we want our resource to become free as soon as possible
        & Analyzing the Algorithm
        && All requests will definitely be compatible
        && Cannot show that this produces the optimal, because there are many optimal algorithms
        && Simply show that this algorithm contains same number of intervals as the optimal
        && Do this by comparing partial solutions from greedy to the optimal and show that greedy is doing as good or better
        & Proof
        && Let Greedy Algorithm produce set of requests A = $i_1, ..., i_k$
        && Let Optimal set O = $j_1, ..., j_m$
        && Greedy rule guarantees $f(i_1) \le f(j_1)$
        && Goal is to show $k = m$
        && (4.2) Lemma: For all indices $r \le k$ we have $f(i_r) \le f(j_r)$
        &&& Proof by induction
        &&& This is true for $r=1$
        &&& Suppose true for $r-1$, prove for $r$
        &&& Wrt one step, greedy would only finish after optimal if it chose a later-finishing interval.
        &&& Formally, $f(j_{r-1}) \le s(j_r)$ by compatibility
        &&& $f(i_{r-1}) \le s(j_r)$ bc $f(i_{r-1}) \le f(j_{r-1})$ 
        &&& So greedy can always pick the same job as optimal
        && (4.3) Greedy algorithm returns an optimal set
        &&& Since next request from optimal starts after $j_k$ and thus after $i_k$, Greedy is able to pick it
        & Interval Partitioning Problem
        && Ex: Lectures at predefined start/end times need to be scheduled in classrooms, want to minimize number of classrooms used
        && Depth is the maximum number of set of intervals that pass over any single point in time
        && Number of resources needed is at least the $d=$ depth of set of intervals
        && Assign label to each interval, label is in range from $1, ..., depth$
        && Basically, just sweep through interval left to right, assigning nonconflicting labels to intervals
        && (4.5) Every interval will be assigned a label and no two overlapping intervals will receive same label
        && Proof 
        &&& Consider one interval $I_j$ and $t$ intervals earlier that overlap it
        &&& Then there are $t+1 \le d$ and so $t \le d-1$
        &&& So there is at least one label which can be assigned to $I_j$
        &&& No intervals overlap because no labels are reassigned in same interval by definition
    \end{easylist}

\subsection{Shortest Paths in a Graph}
    \begin{easylist}  
    \ListProperties(Hide=100, Hang=true, Progressive=4ex, Style*=--\ , Style2*=$\bullet\ $)
        & Single-source Shortest-paths Problem
        && Dijkstra
        && Maintain set S of vertices u for which we have determined a shortest-path distance
        && Extend set by finding vertex with path through explored set with minimum cost
        && (4.14) Consider set S at any point in algorithm's execution. For each $u \in S$ the path $P_u$ is a shortest path $s-u$ path
        && Proof by induction
        &&& Base case is trivial
        &&& Suppose true for $|S|=k$, prove for $k+1$ by adding node $v$ using edge $(u, v)$ to complete path $P_v$
        &&& By induction, $P_u$ is shortest from $s-u, u \in S$
        &&& Any other path $s-v$ must be at least as long as $P_v$ because it is already at least as long as $P_v$ by the time it leaves set $S$
        &&& This is because Dijkstra had already considered adding other nodes, but chose not to do that because they are not the smallest path available
        & Dijkstra does not work with negative lengths
        & Dijkstra as droplet propagation in a system of water pipes
        & Can use heap to run in O(E * log V)
